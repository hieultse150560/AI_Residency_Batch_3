# Fine-Grained Image Classification Task on FGVC-Aircraft Dataset.
This is a project on round 3 of FPT Residency Program Batch 3 for doing Fine-Grained Image Classification.
* Research and propose a simple method for achieving good result on FGVC-Aircraft Dataset.
* Using LaTex for representing the strategy.
